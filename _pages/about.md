# About me

I am currently a second-year doctoral student at Centre for Bioinformatics and Intelligent Medicine ([**BioAIMed Lab**](https://bio.nankai.edu.cn/)), Nankai University, supervised by Prof. [Jian Liu](http://bio.nankai.edu.cn/profiles/liu.html). 

My research lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence and healthcare. I mainly focus on computational pathology and multi-omics data analysis. My objective is to develop advanced AI techniques to enhance in-depth cancer research.

I received my B.S. and master degree in control science and engineering from Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology (NUIST), China. I was supervised by Prof. [Jun Xu](https://faculty.nuist.edu.cn/jxu/zh_CN/index.htm) during my postgraduate period.

I once worked in [Zhejiang Dahua Technology Co., Ltd.](https://www.dahuatech.com/) for one year as an full-time algorithm engineer in 2021.

Now, I have started a new journey (a journey full of glory and dreams) and I believe everything will be fine. If you’re interested in my work or encounter any research problems, please feel free to [contact me](cyyan@mail.nankai.edu.cn).
